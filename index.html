            <h4 class="subtitle">My name is Yago.</h4>
            <p>I am a web developer and UX designer based in the beautiful west coast of Spain, Galicia.</p>
            <p>I really enjoy solving problems as well as making things pretty and easy to use. I can't stop learning new things; the more, the better. I also love photography, a hobby I'm taking along since the good old film cameras. Oh, and rice with milk; I have a passion for rice with milk!</p>

            <h3>What does he do?</h3>

          <div class="desc">
            <h4 class="subtitle">I'm a programmer.</h4>
            <p>For the front-end I usually work with Javascript, either standalone or including popular frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS. I also make the web pretty by using Sass, CSS and, whenever needed, any of their friends: Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.</p>
            <p>For the back-end I also work with Javascript (NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, etc). But, of course, whenever the project requires PHP, I do PHP as well (Wordpress, Laravel, etc).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="desc">
            <h4 class="subtitle">Also a designer.</h4>
            <p>I feel comfortable working with many Adobe products. Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom or Xd are some kind of industry standards and I love working with them. I'm not limited to them, though: Gimp, Inkscape or Figma are also very valid applications that I've been working with.</p>
            <p>User interfaces, brochures, books, branding... You name it! As I mentioned, creating pretty things is particularly important for me.</p>
